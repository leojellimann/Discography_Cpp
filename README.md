# Discography_Cpp
Musical discography built in C++ in 2020 for my second year of computer science school at the University.

The purpose of this project was to create differents C++ class like Instrument, Artists, Groups, Albums.
During this project, we also had to show that we understood the overloads methods principle.
We also had to show that we understood the attribution of object from one class to another class.
For example, we had to attribute the guitar from the class Instrument to the musicien Bernard Summer, who is a member of a specific group. 

Here is an example of the output coming from my program :
